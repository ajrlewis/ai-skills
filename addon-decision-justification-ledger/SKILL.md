# Add-on: Decision Justification Ledger

Use this skill when decision visibility is required by default and no non-trivial change should ship without a recorded rationale.

## Compatibility

- Works with all `architect-*`, `addon-*`, and `ui-*` skills.
- Required default for `production-default` mode.

## Inputs

Collect:
- `DECISION_LOG_LEVEL`: `standard` | `strict` (default `strict`).
- `DECISION_SCOPE`: `architecture-only` | `architecture+implementation` (default `architecture+implementation`).
- `DECISION_LOG_PATH`: default `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.
- `DECISION_TRACE_PATH`: default `REVIEW_BUNDLE/DECISION_TRACE.md`.

## Integration Workflow

1. Add decision visibility artifacts:
```text
docs/DECISION_LOG.md
REVIEW_BUNDLE/DECISION_TRACE.md
```

2. Record each non-trivial decision in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`:
- Decision ID
- Context and requirement
- Options considered
- Chosen option
- Concrete justification
- Tradeoffs and residual risks
- Validation evidence

3. Link changed files to decision IDs in `REVIEW_BUNDLE/DECISION_TRACE.md` so reviewers can map code to rationale quickly.

4. Keep entries append-only for auditability; corrections should be new entries that reference previous IDs.

## Required Template

### `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`
```markdown
# Decision Log

## DEC-001 <short title>
- Context: <what requirement or constraint triggered this>
- Options: <A>, <B>, <C>
- Chosen: <selected option>
- Justification: <why this option is best for this case>
- Tradeoffs: <known downsides>
- Risks: <residual risk + mitigations>
- Evidence: <tests/build/checks/docs>
```

### `REVIEW_BUNDLE/DECISION_TRACE.md`
```markdown
# Decision Trace

| File | Decision ID | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| src/app/main.py | DEC-001 | Chose local lexical index for offline deterministic retrieval |
```

## Guardrails

- No non-trivial decision without rationale.
- Do not use generic claims like "best practice" as a sole justification.
- If alternatives were not considered, explicitly state why only one path is viable.
- Missing decision entries are merge blockers in production-default mode.

## Validation Checklist

```bash
test -f docs/DECISION_LOG.md
test -f REVIEW_BUNDLE/DECISION_TRACE.md
rg -n "## DEC-[0-9]{3}" docs/DECISION_LOG.md
rg -n "Justification:|Tradeoffs:|Risks:" docs/DECISION_LOG.md
```


## Decision Justification Rule

- Every non-trivial decision must include a concrete justification.
- Capture the alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
- State tradeoffs and residual risks for the chosen option.
- If justification is missing, treat the task as incomplete and surface it as a blocker.
