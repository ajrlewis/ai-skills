# UI: Editorial Writing Surface

Use this skill when an app needs a text-first long-form writing surface with strong typography and clean authoring workflow.

## Compatibility

- Best with `architect-nextjs-bun-app`.
- Recommended with `addon-domain-semantic-adaptation` for domain vocabulary in writing/publish UX.
Common pairings:
- `addon-nostr-client-nextjs`
- `addon-nostr-key-custody`
- `addon-nostr-nip23-longform`
- `addon-llm-ancient-greek-translation`

## Inputs

Collect:
- `VISUAL_DIRECTION`: `minimal` | `serif-classic` | `high-contrast`.
- `CONTENT_MODE`: `journal` | `essay` | `notes`.
- `STYLE_INSPIRATION`: short natural-language descriptor from user prompt.
- `ENABLE_SPLIT_VIEW`: `yes` | `no` (default `yes`).

## Integration Workflow

1. Add files:
```text
src/app/journal/page.tsx
src/app/journal/journal.css
src/components/journal/journal-shell.tsx
src/components/journal/editor-pane.tsx
src/components/journal/translation-pane.tsx
src/components/journal/publish-controls.tsx
```
- Import `./journal.css` from `src/app/journal/page.tsx`.

2. UI contract:
- Typography-first layout with generous line height and restrained palette.
- Long-form editor with title + body and clear content hierarchy.
- Optional translation/preview pane when translation add-on is present.
- Publish controls that integrate with selected protocol add-ons.

3. Integrate add-ons:
- Translation pane reads from Ancient Greek translation route.
- Publish controls call long-form publish flow.
- Posting remains disabled until signer is unlocked/authenticated.

## Required UI Contract

- Mobile: single column flow.
- Desktop: editor and translation split view (when enabled).
- Distinct states: draft, translating, ready-to-publish, publish-error.
- Explicit signer status (locked/unlocked, signer kind).
- Internal navigation uses `next/link`.

## Design Guardrails

- Avoid noisy cards or social-feed chrome.
- Keep visual hierarchy driven by type scale and spacing, not heavy borders.
- Maintain comfortable reading measure for long text.
- Ensure focus styles are visible on keyboard navigation.
- Apply prompt-provided tone/style at implementation time instead of creating one-off UI skills.

## Validation Checklist

```bash
bun run lint
bun run build
```
Fallback (`offline-smoke`):
```bash
test -f src/app/journal/page.tsx
test -f src/app/journal/journal.css
rg -n "next/link" src/components/journal || true
```
- Manual checks:
- Drafting and translation preview are both usable on mobile and desktop.
- Publish controls remain disabled until key auth/signing is available.

## Decision Justification Rule

- Every non-trivial decision must include a concrete justification.
- Capture the alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
- State tradeoffs and residual risks for the chosen option.
- If justification is missing, treat the task as incomplete and surface it as a blocker.
